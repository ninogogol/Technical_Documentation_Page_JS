                    <p>Let's start from the beginning.<br>
                        A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of
                        special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform. Usually
                        code is saved in a text file, although with JavaScript you can also
                        type code directly into a developer console in a browser, which well
                        cover shortly.
                    </p>
                    <p>The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called
                        a computer language, sometimes referred to as its syntax, much the
                        same as English tells you how to spell words and how to create valid
                        sentences using words and punctuation.
                    </p>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Statements">
                <header>
                    <h2>Statements</h2>
                </header>
                <article>
                    <p>In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators
                        that performs a specific task is a statement. In JavaScript, a statement
                        might look as follows:
                    </p>
                        <pre>
                            <code>a = b * 2;</code>
                        </pre>
                    <p>The characters <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are called variables, which are like simple boxes you can store any of your stuff in.
                        In programs, variables hold values (like the number 42) to be used
                        by the program. Think of them as symbolic placeholders for the values themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>By contrast, the <span>2</span> is just a value itself, called a literal value, because it
                        stands alone without being stored in a variable.
                        The <span>=</span> and <span>*</span> characters are operators.
                        They perform actions with the values and variables such as assign-
                        ment and mathematic multiplication.
                        Most statements in JavaScript conclude with a semicolon (;) at theg
                        end.
                        The statement 
                        <code>a = b * 2;</code> tells the computer, roughly, to get the
                        current value stored in the variable <span>b</span>, multiply that value by <span>2</span>, then
                        store the result back into another variable we call <span>a</span>.
                        Programs are just collections of many such statements, which
                        together describe all the steps that it takes to perform your pro-
                        gram's purpose.

                <article>
                    <p>Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is
                        any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and
                        value(s) combined with operators.<br>
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>a = b * 2;</code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        This statement has four expressions in it:
                        <ul class="js">
                            <li class="p-li"> <span>2</span> is a literal value expression.</li>
                            <li class="p-li"> <span>b</span> is a variable expression, which means to retrieve its current
                                value.</li>
                            <li class="p-li"><span>b * 2</span> is an arithmetic expression, which means to do the multi-
                                plication.</li>
                            <li class="p-li"><span>a = b * 2</span> is an assignment expression, which means to assign
                                the result of the <span>b * 2</span> expression to the variable <span>a</span> </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A general expression that stands alone is also called an expression
                        statement, such as the following:
                        <pre>
                            <code>b * 2;</code>
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This flavor of expression statement is not very common or useful, as
                        generally it wouldn't have any effect on the running of the program
                        -it would retrieve the value of <span>b</span> and multiply it by <span>2</span>, but then
                        wouldn't do anything with that result.

                        How do those collections of programming statements tell the com-
                        puter what to do? The program needs to be executed, also referred to
                        as running the program.
                        Statements like <span>a = b * 2</span> are helpful for developers when reading
                        and writing, but are not actually in a form the computer can directly
                        understand. So a special utility on the computer
                        is used to translate the code you write into com
                        mands a computer can understand
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typi-
                        cally done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program
                        is run, which is usually called interpreting the code.
                        For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called
                        compiling the code, so when the program runs later, whats running
                        is actually the already compiled computer instructions ready to go.
                        It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your Java-
                        Script source code is processed ach time it's run. But that's not
                        entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually compiles the pro-
                        gram on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.

                        Let's get familiar with the process of running code in the console.
                        First, I suggest opening up an empty tab in your browser. I prefer to
                        do this by typing about: blank into the address bar. Then, make sure
                        your developer console is open, as we just mentioned.<br>
                        Now, type this code and see how it runs:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="output">
                            a = 21;
                            b = a * 2.
                            console.log(b);
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="bottom-list-item">
                                Typing the preceding code into the console in Chrome should 
                                produce something like the following:
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
